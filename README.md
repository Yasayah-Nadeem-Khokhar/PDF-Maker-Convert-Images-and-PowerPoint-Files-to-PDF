## **Usage**  

### 1. **Convert Images to PDF**  
```python
from pdf_maker import convert_images_to_pdf

input_files = ["image1.jpg", "image2.png"]  # Add your image paths here
output_pdf = "output.pdf"
convert_images_to_pdf(input_files, output_pdf)
```

### 2. **Convert PowerPoint to PDF**  
```python
from pdf_maker import convert_ppt_to_pdf, merge_pdfs

input_files = ["presentation1.pptx", "presentation2.ppt"]  # Add your PPT/PPTX paths here
pdf_paths = convert_ppt_to_pdf(input_files)
merge_pdfs(pdf_paths, "merged_output.pdf")
```

### 3. **Merge PDFs**  
```python
from pdf_maker import merge_pdfs

pdf_files = ["file1.pdf", "file2.pdf"]  # Add your PDF paths here
output_pdf = "merged.pdf"
merge_pdfs(pdf_files, output_pdf)
```

---

## **Example**  
```python
# Convert images to PDF
convert_images_to_pdf(["photo1.jpg", "photo2.png"], "images.pdf")

# Convert PowerPoint to PDF and merge
pdf_paths = convert_ppt_to_pdf(["slide1.pptx", "slide2.ppt"])
merge_pdfs(pdf_paths, "presentation.pdf")

# Merge existing PDFs
merge_pdfs(["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"], "final.pdf")
```
